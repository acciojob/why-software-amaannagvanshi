	As I am already working as a Graphic Designer for past 4 years so it clears that I am intersted in giving a chance to my imagination to come in reality.
	But, truely I have a logical mind which makes my interest more in technical works rather than creativity.
	And here in Software Developer field, I feel that It it the place where I can do the job with my full interest.
